# The-Ultimate-Device
This repository is documentation for my hand controlled robot car. The steps and skills needed for this car is not your average merrygoround. Using an accelerometer that communicates with an arduino micro 5v using the I2C protocol, the device will be able to use serial communication to transmit data over long distances. With the exception of two bluetooth modules on both transmitter and reciever, to transmit and recieve data wirelessly.
